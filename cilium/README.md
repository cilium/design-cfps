# Cilium CFP

This folder is dedicated to CFPs that proposes a change to multiple SIGs, and cannot be placed in it's own appropriate folder (for example, Hubble or Tetragon).

CFPs in this folder must have a Cilium Committer approve it in order for it reach the `Provisional` status.

Not sure who to ask for help? Take a look in our community repo which lists the Github handles for [SIG team leads](https://github.com/cilium/community/tree/main/ladder/teams) for your particular area of interest, ask in our Cilium Slack Channel, or attend a community meeting if you need help narrowing down specific individuals to ask.
